## SLIDE DECK BELOW

---

### Slide 1 - Title Slide

* Vamp for 15 seconds

### Slide 2 - Who Am I

* I am from Orlando and one of the co-organizers for the Orlando DevOps Community Group.
* I am a Solution Architect for Progress Chef
* I also am a Mentor for my sons FIRST Robotics Team
* I am a firm believer in utilizing Agile DevOps practices and principles
* I also believe in treating all of your daily work in an As Code approach! But that is a different presentation.

### Slide 3 - DevOpsDays

* I Discovered DevOps from DevOpsDays Nashville in 2016
* Anyone want to guess who the first speaker was that day?
  * Andrew Clay Shafer presented [Chop Wood, Carry Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sy3XfC0qv8).
* This is my 12th DevOpsDays in my 7th city. This is th 3rd time I've been here in Tampa Bay!

### Side 4 - Talk about this talk

* Here is what we are going to do.
* Raise your hands if you have been to a DevOpsDays before?
* Keep them raised if you stayed and participated in Open Spaces
* All down. How many of you have never heard of Open Spaces

### Slide 5 - What are Open Spaces (Literally, slide says Open Spaces very large)

* We're talking about Open Spaces! They don't get much more open than that.
* So what are Open Spaces at DevOpsDays?
* They are meant to facilitate open discussions around topics chosen by the participants
* We'll get into the details of that in a bit.
* First let's go over the four principles and one law.

### Slide 6 - Whoever Comes is the RIGHT People

* All of the folks that show up, well, those are the people that are supposed to be there.
* There is no discretion to who should be there.
* If someone goes and grabs some to join, they are the right people.

### Slide 7 - Whatever Happens HAPPENS

* Simply go with the flow! If the topic diverges, or goes off the deep end, that's fine.
* If someone starts side conversations, that's what happens.
* If unicorns come streaming in with pixies upon their backs, it was meant to be.

### Slide 8 - Whenever it starts is the RIGHT TIME

* In the context of Open Spaces today, they are going to start around 3:00 today.
* But what this really means is as you gather, if the group isn't ready to dive into the topic, take another minute or two with introductions.

### Slide 9 - When it's Over, IT'S OVER

* Again, we have some limitations to this today because after 30 minutes, it's over.
* But that doesn't mean that if the topic ends at 15 minutes you have to hang around.
* And really, these discussions can keep happening over beverages later. Or Slack. Or wherever!

### Slide 10 - The Law of Mobility

* This is the LAW that makes those principles possible.
* Ultimately, all of the above principles are controlled by the Law of Two Feet.
* If you aren't comfortable, or getting value, or participating, use the Law of Two Feet.
* Don't feel obligated to stay if you aren't learning what you hoped, have a call to make, etc.
* Everyone should feel free to come and go as they choose for the reason they choose.

### Slide 11 - Bring Your Best Self

* This one isn't in the book of Open Spaces, but I think we should appreciate it.
* Discussions and conduct should be in alignment with DevOpsDays Code of Conduct.
* If you feel the Code of Conduct is broken, please use the Law of Two Feet straight to one of the staff members.
* Ultimately, we are a community of Professionals and we should always be Professional.

### Slide 12 - My thoughts as to why they are great

* So why do I think they are the greatest part of DevOpsDays?
* A couple of quick reasons.
* They allow open discussions about topics we care about. Today!
* They allow deeper dives into the presentations we have heard.
* They encourage collaboration with our peers.
* They let us interact with one another.
* Social interaction and discussions is one of the best forms of Knowledge Transfer!

### Slide 13 - Some of my favorite topics

* So one of the things that is difficult for some is to come up with things they want to talk about.
* Usually it's the next day when I think of a really good one.
* But I'm here to help, so here are a few of my favorite topics of the past.
* As I just mentioned, Practicing Lean Coffee
* Or, How has DevOps Changed? Have we succeeded?
* How does Chat Ops help teams grow and learn?
* Working Across Time Zones / Continental Divides / Dealing with Different DevOps Cultures
* How does Agile work with DevOps?
* Local DevOps Meetups.
* Lessons Learned Planning a DevOpsDays.

### Slide 14 - If all else fails, play Werewolf

* When you are in Doubt, you can always ask Andrew Clay Shafer to host a round of Werewolf.
* In fact, that was one of my first and favorite open spaces at DevOpsDays Nashville in 2016.
* Being my first event, it really put me at ease to particpate in other spaces.
* Feel free to put that down!

### Slide 15 - Submit your topics (Post it / QR Code)

* So you've heard a lot of good talks
* You've listened to me describe my favorite things
* Now we want to hear the things you want to discuss.
* We are going to take all of the suggestions and compile them.
* Immediately following the last presentation today, we will review the entire list.

### Slide 16 - We're going to vote

* If you submitted a topic and aren't too shy, we will invite you all up to give 15 seconds of fame and inject a bit more background on your proposed topic.
* Voting will begin immediately following those intros via Google Forms.
* We will have this QR Code up again and open the polls for voting.
* After 5 minutes, we will tally up the results, announce the topics and locations and then jump into the spaces.

### Slide 17 - Take Notes

* A member of the Orlando DevOps Community Group will join each of the topic breakouts.
* They are not there to host, but to take some notes and "keep time"
* At 25 minutes, if not before, the group should come up with a few top tips, things discovered, outcomes, take aways, calls to action.
* At the Closing, we will take about 5 minutes to review all we learned from the breakouts

### Slide 18 - Taking this smaller (Lean Coffee)

* I wanted to call out Lean Coffee as a great shorter version of Open Spaces
* Our Orlando DevOps Community group does this every month.
* The principle of coming with topics and voting on them is the same.
* You generally are time bound to 5 minutes per topic.
* Want to learn more? Submit it as an Open Space topic!

### Slide 19 - Thank youse
